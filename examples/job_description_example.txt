Summary
Machine Learning Engineer for Deal Intelligence Platform (Pilot Project)

Title:
Machine Learning Engineer Needed (Graph, Embeddings, ML Matching) — Pilot Project for AI Deal Platform

About the Project

I’m building an AI-driven deal origination platform (companies → investors → acquirers).
I need a skilled ML engineer to help build the first version of the intelligence layer.

This is not a full-time role.
This is a paid pilot project to build a small, working prototype of:

Company & investor embeddings

Basic matching model (cosine similarity or simple ML model)

Small deal graph representation

Simple scoring function (fit score)

If the collaboration is strong, this continues into advanced work (graph ML, multi-agent system, RL, etc.), but for now the scope is small and affordable.

What I Need in This First Milestone
Milestone 1 (Fixed budget: $150–$300 depending on experience)

✔ Extract text from ~50–100 companies + investors
✔ Generate embeddings (OpenAI, HuggingFace, or similar)
✔ Build a simple vector search or similarity scoring
✔ Output: a list of “best-matching investors for each company”
✔ Bonus (optional): small graph structure and simple centrality score

This is an MVP intelligence layer, not the full system.

Ideal Skills

You should know at least a few of these:

Python

ML fundamentals

Embeddings (OpenAI, HuggingFace, or Sentence Transformers)

Vector search (Faiss, pgvector, or similar)

Basic knowledge graph or graph libraries (optional but helpful)

Simple ML models (logistic regression, XGBoost, etc.)

You do NOT need deep RL or multi-agent experience at this stage.

Deliverables

Clean Python notebook or script

A CSV/JSON showing:

Embeddings

Fit scores

Ranked investor lists

Short explanation of your approach

Requirements

Be fast and reliable

Be comfortable with early-stage ambiguity

Speak clear English

Deliver small results quickly

If you’re strong, I will continue with you for bigger, well-compensated tasks later (graph ML, personalization engine, agent system, etc.)
