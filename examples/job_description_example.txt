Summary
Project Overview

We are a consultancy working with professional services and consulting firms. We are looking for an experienced AI/Automation developer to build a production-grade document extraction application.

The system will allow clients to:
- Upload multiple PDF files (e.g., invoices, energy bills)
- Automatically extract relevant fields
- Structure the data logically
- Return a clean Excel / CSV output suitable for analytics

What We Need Built

- Multi-file upload capability (drag-and-drop UI or API endpoint)
- AI-powered OCR and structured data extraction
- Field-driven extraction logic (e.g., supplier, consumption, amount, dates, VAT, reference numbers)
- Ability to define and refine extraction rules via prompt or configuration
- Consolidation of multiple documents into one structured Excel file (same type of invoices)
- Output downloadable or emailed to user
- Logging + error handling for failed extractions

Nice-to-have:
- Support for non-standard PDFs (scans, poor quality, pictures)
- Template learning or model fine-tuning from examples
- Dashboard to manage uploaded files and results

Ideal Tech Approach (Flexible)
- We are open to architecture proposals. Potential stack components include:
- Python or Node back-end
- LLM-based extraction (e.g., GPT/VLM APIs, tesseract/OCR, doc AI tools such as Azure Form Recognizer / AWS Textract / Google Document AI)
- Front-end upload module (basic UI or API gateway)
- Data pipeline for mapping results → Excel (openpyxl / pandas or equivalent)

Desired Profile
- You should have demonstrated experience in:
- AI document extraction / OCR automation
- Building production-grade SaaS components
- Prompt-based extraction or schema-guided parsing
- Handling messy PDF layouts, including scans
- Generating structured data outputs

Bonus if you’ve built:
- invoice/billing extraction apps
- RPA or n8n integrations
- accounting/finance workflow tools

Deliverables:
- Working PDF-to-Excel extraction module with API/UI
- Backend logic allowing us to define which fields to extract
- Excel output generator (consolidated dataset)
- Deployment instructions + handover call
- Documentation & maintainability notes

Later extensions (separate paid milestones) may include:
- Client accounts & dashboards
- Extraction rule training interface
- Upload → Processing queue → Analytics pipelines
