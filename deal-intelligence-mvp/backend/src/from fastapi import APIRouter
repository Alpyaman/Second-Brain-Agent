# --- Endpoint Enumerator (Pattern 4) ---
# While not a direct class implementation here, the structure of api_router
# and its included routers effectively enumerates the available API endpoints.
# For a more explicit implementation, one could create a utility function
# that inspects api_router.routes to list all available paths and methods.
